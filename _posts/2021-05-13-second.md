Signaling is a behavior that attempts to provide the information about an attribute unobserved to the counterpart. There are several characteristics of a signaling situation. First, both a (group of) provider(s) and a (groupd of) receiver(s) must be considered in signaling theory. 

To my knowledge, the work of Akerlof (1970, QJE) is the seminar paper about signaling theory in economics.
