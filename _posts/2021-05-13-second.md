Signaling is a behavior that attempts to provide the information about an attribute unobserved to the counterpart. There are several characteristics of a signaling situation. First, both a (group of) provider(s) and a (groupd of) receiver(s) must be considered in signaling theory. Second, the receiver cannot observe the attribute of interest. Third, the provider can choose either to provide the signal or not. 

Those three characteristics are not sufficient to guarantee the existence of signaling. 

To my knowledge, the work of Akerlof (1970, QJE) is the seminar paper about signaling theory in economics.
